## About
This is a tiny console game which is written in BASH language. The initial goal of this game is to help the computer new comers to practice the keyboard. Once the game starts it will generate letters randomly and falling down like a bomb. The game player should input the charater to remove the bomb. Once a "bomb" landed, "BOOM ...", GAME OVER.
